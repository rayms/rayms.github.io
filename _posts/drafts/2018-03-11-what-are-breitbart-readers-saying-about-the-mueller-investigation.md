title: 'What are Breitbart readers saying about the Mueller investigation? '
---

The polarized response to the Nunes memo, Russia indictments, and other Mueller bombshells illustrate the worrying  fragmentation of the media landscape in the United States. More and more, we see that right-wing media outlets have retreated wilfully into their own bubbles: from the Russia scandal to Roy Moore’s sexual assaults, these organizations have sought to dismiss and distort. 

What do readers of these media think though? To get a better idea about what this ecosystem looks like up close, I gathered the 106 most recent Breitbart News articles related to the Mueller investigation and scraped over 300,000 reader comments. Which articles elicited the most engagement, and what are people saying about them? How long, on average, did it take people to comment on an article about Mueller? And could the comments section, like social media, be full of trolls and so-called “cyber troops” trying to shape the narrative in Trump’s favor?

The Breitbart articles with the most comments are those about Mueller's investigation honing in on Trump Jr. and the Trump family, as well as the recent indictments of Russians for interference in the 2016 elections, and the potential for impeachment. Laura Ingraham manages to make it into two of the top articles, with one article attempting to cast aspersions on the Mueller investigation and the other attempting to divert attention to Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and former President Obama. 

Clinton and Obama are the object of many articles on Breitbart News, so perhaps it's unsurprising that they are also a fixation for many readers as well.

Using Julia Silge and David Robins's great R package, tidytext, we can break readers' comments up into individual words and count the frequency of their occurence. This gives us an idea about the main themes found in readers' comments.

I've highlighted some of the most frequently occuring words, such as Hillary, Obama, and Comey, but there are also words here as well: "fire" (as in "fire Mueller"), "sessions" (Jeff), "collusion," and "uranium." How often are readers talking about Hillary, Obama, and Comey?

We see that the number of comments mentioning all three of them has stayed pretty consistent, and peaked in December 2017. What about "uranium" - how often are readers mentioning this word and why?

We can see that the number of comments mentioning 'uranium' peaked in October 2017. But what are these comments about? We can take a look with a sample.
