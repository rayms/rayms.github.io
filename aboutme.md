My name is Ray and I'm a Senior Programe Officer and Governance and Innovation Expert at [Democracy Reporting International](http://www.democracy-reporting.org), where I manage an EU-funded project in Myanmar. Previously, I've worked on electoral and constitutional projects in Tunisia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  

I started this blog because of my interest in data science and to document my progress with learning the R programming language. 

I double majored in Political Studies and Creative Writing at Pitzer College ('12) in Claremont, California. Before that, I was in the US Armed Forces for six years, where I worked as a communications specialist.
