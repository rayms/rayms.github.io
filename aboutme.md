I'm a Senior Programe Officer and Governance and Innovation Expert at [Democracy Reporting International](http://www.democracy-reporting.org), where I manage an EU-funded project in Myanmar and work more broadly on Asia. Previously, I've worked on electoral and constitutional projects in Tunisia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  

I started this blog because of my interest in data science and to document my progress with learning the R programming language. I double majored in Political Studies and Creative Writing at Pitzer College ('12) in Claremont, California. Before that, I was in the US Armed Forces for six years, where I worked as a communications specialist. 

You can find some of my research on social media, hate speech, and elections reported in the [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis), [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/06/asia/myanmar-facebook-social-media-genocide-intl/index.html), [The Irrawaddy](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/soar-dubious-twitter-accounts-since-rakhine-attacks.html), and [The Daily Times](https://dailytimes.com.pk/220506/220506/).
